👋 Hi, I’m @Mourdhwaj 

👀 I’m interested in AI/ML, Data analysis, Automation, and learning new technologies. 
   I enjoy solving complex problems and improving system efficiencies. 
   
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced AI/ML techniques, SQL for data management, and exploring new tools in data                visualization like Tableau. I'm also diving into AI technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs), LangChain, and.     Vector Databases (VectorBD). 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to AI/ML, data analysis, and automation. I'm also open to contributing      to open-source projects that align with my skills and interest.
